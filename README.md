# Hyperion-T38-Semantic-Similarity

In semantics.py I use spaCy to look at semantic similarity between individual words and short sentences

In movie_next.py I use spaCy to compare a longer string (in this case a description of a movie) against other strings stored on a file and find the most similar result

As both of these use spaCy I have included an installation file, requirements.txt which can be installed by typing pip install -r requirements.txt into the command line
